# NO LONGER MAINTAINED #

**Update:** These apps are no longer maintained. Sorry. You are welcome to fork the project under the GNU GPL.

These are two Android applications that load and displays live precious prices and charts from Kitco.com. The first application (kitco-android) displays four precious metal prices and charts: Gold (Au), Silver (Ag), Platinum (Pt), and Palladium (Pd). The second application (kitco-gold-android) displays only gold prices on one page.

NOTE: These are not official programs by Kitco Metals, Inc. I asked permission to use their charts for an android program, and they said it was fine as long as I linked to Kitco.com. I wrote the code myself and will release it under GPLv2.
